# python-signalr-client
**Python** signalR client using asyncio.
It's mainly based on [TargetProcess signalR client](https://github.com/TargetProcess/signalr-client-py) which uses gevent.

I am mainly developing the client for my **[Python Bittrex Websocket](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket)** project, however I would make it as universal as possible.

The library will only work with Python3.
